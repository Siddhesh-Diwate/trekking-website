      <h2>About Sinhgad Fort Trek</h2>
      <p>
        Sinhgad Fort, also known as "Lion's Fort," is one of the most popular and accessible treks near Pune, located about 30–40 km from the city center. Perched atop a steep hill in the Sahyadri Mountains, it stands at approximately 1,312 meters above sea level and offers breathtaking views of the surrounding valleys and Khadakwasla Lake.

        The trek is considered easy to moderate, making it suitable for beginners and families. The trail starts from the base village (often Donje Gaon or Avtar Wadi) and is about 2.5–3 km long, featuring a mix of gentle slopes and steeper sections[2][4][7]. The path winds through lush greenery, rocky outcrops, and past snack stalls, especially vibrant during the monsoon season.

        Sinhgad Fort is steeped in history, having witnessed many battles, most notably the Battle of Sinhagad led by Tanaji Malusare. The fort is well-preserved and features ancient gates, temples, and memorials. It is a favorite spot for both history buffs and nature lovers, offering a perfect blend of adventure, heritage, and scenic beauty.
