      <h2>About Vasota Trek</h2>
      <p>
        Vasota Fort, also known as Vyaghragad (Tiger Fort), is an ancient fort nestled deep within the dense forests of the Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary in Satara district. The fort stands at an elevation of 1,171 meters (about 3,841 feet) and is surrounded by the serene backwaters of the Shivsagar Lake on three sides, offering breathtaking panoramic views.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trek to Vasota Fort is considered moderate in difficulty and begins from Bamnoli village. Trekkers enjoy a scenic boat ride across the lake to reach the trailhead, followed by a hike through lush green forests filled with diverse flora and fauna. The trail is known for its rich biodiversity, and you may spot wildlife such as leopards, sloth bears, deer, and numerous bird species.

        Vasota Fort was built in the 12th century and holds significant historical value as a strategic outpost of the Maratha Empire. Today, it is a favorite among trekkers for its unique blend of adventure, wildlife, history, and stunning natural beauty.
