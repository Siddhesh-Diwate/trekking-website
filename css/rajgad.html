      <h2>About Rajgad Trek</h2>
      <p>
        Rajgad Fort, known as the "King of Forts," is one of the most majestic and historically significant forts in Maharashtra. Located about 60 km from Pune, it was the first capital of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and remained his residence for over two decades. Rajgad is renowned for its massive size, intricate fortifications, and stunning views of the Sahyadri range.

        The trek is moderate in difficulty and usually starts from the base village of Gunjavane. The trail winds through lush green fields, dense forests, and rocky patches, offering a mix of natural beauty and adventure. The climb involves steep ascents, especially near Chor Darwaja and Balekilla, but the effort is rewarded with breathtaking panoramas and a glimpse into Maratha history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rajgad Fort features three main plateaus (Machi): Padmavati, Suvela, and Sanjivani. Each offers unique views and historical remnants, including ancient temples, water tanks, and remnants of royal palaces. The fort is a favorite among trekkers for its challenging terrain, rich heritage, and serene environment.
